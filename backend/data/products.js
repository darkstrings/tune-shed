      "Les Paul Voodoo with the mojo sound and juju look. The Gibson classic has been given a conjure treatment: swamp ash body (for lighter weight), ebony fingerboard with a unique red pearl voodoo skull at the 5th fret, 496R and 500T pickups, and black hardware. The finish is painted ebony, then rubbed with a red filler that catches in the grooved of the ash wood grain, and finally sealed with a satin-lacquer finish coat.",

    description:
      "Whether you play rock, metal, or fusion, the Schecter Reaper-6 FR S is a force to be reckoned with. This red-hot axe features a resonant poplar-burl-topped swamp ash body, ensuring maximum natural tone and killer looks. A high-output Diamond Decimator bridge humbucker makes the Reaper-6 FR S the sonic equivalent of a flame thrower but still gives you enough versatility to cover all of your tonal bases. What's more, Schecter gave the Reaper-6 FR S an ultra-cool Sustainiac neck pickup that lets you pull off flying solos like nothing else out there. As for comfort, after experiencing this guitar's sleek body contours, Ultra-access Neck Carve, and fast-playing ebony fingerboard, you'll have a hard time putting it down. The Reaper-6 FR S includes a Floyd Rose 1500 tremolo for rock-solid intonation. Eye-catching black and chrome hardware completes the package. This is one Reaper that you'll want to meet.",

Built with a thermally aged Sitka spruce top, the 1960 Hummingbird reflects the appearance and performance of those early icons. Featuring a fixed bridge, it's finished with Gibson's new Thin Finish, including a hand-rubbed VOS process.",
